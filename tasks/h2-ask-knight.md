# "Ask Knight" entry points across the app

The Knight (Hermes) chat exists (KnightMusic/UI/Knight, KnightMusic/Core/Hermes). `UIState.askKnight(_ prompt: String)` opens the Knight tab
with a new chat whose composer is pre-filled. Read UIState.swift, KnightView.swift and HermesSettings first. Only show these entry points
when Hermes is configured (`HermesSettings.isConfigured` — check how to read it from the environment).
Allowed files: KnightMusic/UI/Search/*, KnightMusic/UI/Detail/ArtistDetailView.swift, KnightMusic/UI/Detail/AlbumDetailView.swift,
KnightMusic/UI/Library/PlaylistsView.swift, KnightMusic/UI/Home/HomeView.swift.

1. Search: when a query has NO results (and also as the last row under results), show a prominent row/button
   "Ask Knight to add “<query>”" (sparkles icon, accent, `.buttonStyle(.glass)`) → `ui.askKnight("Add \(query) to my library")`.
2. ArtistDetailView toolbar ••• menu: "Get more from <artist>" → `ui.askKnight("Add more popular songs by \(artist.name) that I don't have yet")`.
3. AlbumDetailView ••• menu: "Complete this album" → `ui.askKnight("Add the full album \(album.name) by \(artist) — only the tracks I'm missing")`.
4. PlaylistsView toolbar: a sparkles button "Ask Knight for a playlist" → `ui.askKnight("Make me a playlist of ")` (user finishes the sentence).
5. HomeView toolbar ••• menu: "Ask Knight" → `ui.askKnight("")`.
Keep everything else unchanged.

## Shared context for every screen task (read carefully)
- Read CLAUDE.md first (Liquid Glass rules + visual spec). Look at the reference screenshots `ref/IMG_1160.PNG` … `ref/IMG_1172.PNG`
  (Arpeggi on iPad — our exact visual target: black background, red accent, big bold titles, rounded search field,
  album tiles with title + secondary subtitle, inset grouped settings cards).
- Data comes ONLY from the real app services, injected in the environment:
  `@Environment(AppModel.self) var app`, `@Environment(LibraryRepository.self) var library`,
  `@Environment(PlayerEngine.self) var player`, `@Environment(DownloadManager.self) var downloads`,
  `@Environment(AppSettings.self) var settings`, `@Environment(UIState.self) var ui` (KnightMusic/UI/Shell/UIState.swift).
- Library reads use LiveQuery (read KnightMusic/Core/Library/LiveQuery.swift, LibraryRepository.swift, LibraryQueries.swift,
  LibraryTypes.swift for the exact factory names/params/return types):
      let albums = library.albums(sort: .name, search: nil)   // call in body; it's cached
      ... ForEach(albums.value) ...
      .observing(albums)                                        // REQUIRED on the view that shows it
  Use `query.isLoaded` to show a skeleton (`SkeletonTileGrid` / `SkeletonRowList`) instead of a flash of the empty state;
  show `EmptyStateView` only when loaded and empty.
- Playback: `player.play(songs, startAt: index, shuffle: false)`, `player.enqueue(songs, next: true/false)`,
  `player.currentSong?.id` to highlight the playing row. Read KnightMusic/Core/Playback/PlayerEngine*.swift for names.
- Navigation: push with `NavigationLink(value: Route.album(album.id)) { ... }` (KnightMusic/UI/Shell/Routes.swift).
  Do NOT add your own navigationDestination for Route; the shell applies `.withAppRoutes()`.
  Your views must NOT wrap themselves in a NavigationStack (the shell owns it).
- Reuse the design system in KnightMusic/UI/DesignSystem (open the files for exact initializers): Theme, Font.km*,
  KMFormat, ArtworkView, HeroArtworkView, AnimatedArtworkView, AlbumTile, AdaptiveAlbumGrid, ShelfSection, SectionHeader,
  SongRow, NowPlayingIndicator, ArtistRow, PlaylistRow, PlaylistMosaic, AlphabetIndexScrubber, StarRatingView,
  EmptyStateView, LoadingShimmer/SkeletonRowList/SkeletonTileGrid, GlassIconButton, GlassCapsuleBar.
- Song menus: use `SongActionsMenu(song:)` (KnightMusic/UI/Detail/SongActionsMenu.swift) inside `.contextMenu { }` on song rows
  and inside the row's ••• `Menu`.
- Liquid Glass: real APIs only (`.glassEffect`, `GlassEffectContainer`, `.buttonStyle(.glass)`, `.buttonStyle(.glassProminent)`).
  Never `.ultraThinMaterial`/fake blur panels. Content (rows, tiles) is never glass.
- Lists: `.searchable(text:)` where the brief says so (system search field = glass automatically), `.refreshable { await app.pullToRefresh() }`
  on library screens. `.navigationTitle(...)` with large display mode. Black background: `.scrollContentBackground(.hidden)` + `.background(Color.black)` for Lists.
- Everything must work on iPhone (compact) and iPad (regular) — use adaptive layouts, not fixed widths.
- Smoothness: LazyVStack/LazyVGrid/List, stable ids, no heavy work in body, `.animation(.smooth, value:)` on state changes,
  `Haptics` (KnightMusic/Core/Support/Haptics.swift) on play/star.
- No fake/sample data, no TODO placeholders, no "coming soon". Every button does its real job.
